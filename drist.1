.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool to configure remote servers using
.Xr ssh 1
and
.Xr rsync 1 .
.Nm
has been designed to be simple, so it may not offer all the features you want.
.Pp
When you run
.Nm
, it will look at a set of special directories in the current working
directory.
.Nm
will connect to
.Ar server
via ssh(1) and request the remote
.Em HOSTNAME
by calling
.Ql uname -n .
.Pp
After that following steps will be executed:
.Bl -enum -offset indent -compact
.It
If folder
.Ar files
exists, its content is copied to
.Ar server
using
.Xr rsync 1 .
.It
If folder
.Ar files- Ns Em HOSTNAME
exists, its content is copied to
.Ar server
using
.Xr rsync 1 .
.It
If folder
.Ar absent
exists, filenames in it are deleted on
.Ar server .
.It
If folder
.Ar absent- Ns Em HOSTNAME
exists, filenames in it are deleted on
.Ar server .
.It
If file
.Ar script
exists, it is copied to
.Ar server
and executed there.
.It
If file
.Ar script- Ns Em HOSTNAME
exists, it is copied to
.Ar server
and executed there.
.El
.Pp
The presence of each of those files or directories is optional.
.Pp
All files in either
.Ar files
or
.Ar absent
or
.Ar files- Ns Em HOSTNAME
etc. are relative to the root (/) directory.
The specific files for
.Em HOSTNAME
are worked on after the common files.
.Pp
I recommend to write small "modules" which would install the required
packages for a task and provide the files needed, rather than writing a
full-blown module for deploying an entire system at once.
.Nm
does not handle file permissions and ownership.
Those should be modified by the
.Ar script
file.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Please see the
.Ar examples
directory in the
.Nm
distribution.
