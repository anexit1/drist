V2.02 - 2020-08-27
==================

- Fix an issue in which drist wasn't calling exit when the
  temporary directory can't be created


V2.01 - 2020-08-27
==================

- Document the use of a file containg hostnames and that
  drist now supports looping over multiple servers


V2.00 - 2020-08-26
==================

/!\ This update involves major changes, don't use it unless
    you can afford to rewrite all your drist modules.

- remove simulate mode
- remove "absent" support
- files are now copied under ~/.drist_files_XXXXXX which mean
  files must be moved to the system from the script (using
  rsync, install whatever)

This solves many issues:
	- you can't destroy your system because of rsync
	  removing symlink to replace them by directories
	  (common on FreeBSD where /home is a link to /usr/home)
	- files aren't available on the system with a permission
	  derived from the origin server, they can be properly copied
	  with the correct permissions and ownership from the script
	- absent function was not useful
	- simulate option was not useful
